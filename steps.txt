NOTE - To create dynamic routes, have the folder name encased within square brackets. []. This name is case sensitive, so be careful while typing it out.

NOTE - To create a collection of folders, without having to include it in the url, you can do it by enclosing the folder in (). This still is a parent folder, so you can use a layout file here nonetheless.
